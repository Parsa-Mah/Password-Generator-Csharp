# Password-Generator-Csharp
its a program that generates a user-defined length of string (Password) in C sharp (C#)

I always wanted to use this feature in native windows
browsers already had this feature built in but a native windows app
so I creted it my self!

This console app Generates a lenght of random mixed of numbers, alphabets
both lower and upper case and special charecters

the best feature is that this app automatically copys the generated password
to the Windows clipboard after showing you the actual password
